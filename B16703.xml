            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>OF a Powder which is a most safe and speedy help for the <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Gravel,</hi> and those Miseries which attend them, as pain in the <hi>Back,</hi> stoppage of <hi>Ʋrine, Cholick, &amp;c.</hi> of which, in short, take this Impartial Account.</p>
            <p>In the extreamest Fit of the <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Gravel,</hi> it takes off all pain in an hour or two's time; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing freedom of <hi>Ʋrine,</hi> and being duly continued, it either dissolves the <hi>Stone</hi> into a Slime, or brings it away in small Fragments; it also presently easeth the <hi>Cholick,</hi> and clears the <hi>Kidnies</hi> of <hi>Gravel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is indeed a Medicine of great Efficacy, and of a most gentle and friendly Quality, without any <hi>Stupefaction, Corrosivety,</hi> or <hi>Hostility</hi> to <hi>Nature:</hi> And from the Experience of many Years, I can faithfully recommend it for an effectual Remedy in these Diseases, having ever found it to answer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation when duly used.</p>
            <p>But for such as are scrupulous of any farther Charge than may serve their present necessity, I dare affirm, there is nothing more speedy to give them Relief; and were it for that only, it is sufficiently worth their Expense.</p>
            <p>But those that are desirous of Cure, and to that end will continue the use of it, (with God's Blessing) may obtain their desire in short time, and need not be exposed to the hazard of Cutting, which often proves more fatal than the Disease.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The price of this Powder is Six-pence a</hi> Dose, <hi>and is to be had at my House in</hi> New-Queen-Street, <hi>the third Door from</hi> Windmil-Street, <hi>above the</hi> Hay-Market.</p>
